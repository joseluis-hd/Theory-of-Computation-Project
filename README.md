A Finite State Machine (FSM) model for process state management in operating systems. Features a 7-state lifecycle, interactive GUI, and JFLAP simulations. Designed for educational use in OS/theory courses.

## Key Features
- ‚úîÔ∏è Complete implementation of OS process states
- üñ•Ô∏è Graphical representation of CPU, RAM, and disk interactions
- üìä Ready-to-use JFLAP files for demonstrations
- üìö Well-documented code for easy extension
